# Generate Playwright Tests

Generate production-ready Playwright tests from a user story, URL, component name, or feature description.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` contains what to test. Examples:
- `"user can log in with email and password"`
- `"the checkout flow"`
- `"src/components/UserProfile.tsx"`
- `"the search page with filters"`

## Steps

### 1. Understand the Target

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine:
- **User story**: Extract the behavior to verify
- **Component path**: Read the component source code
- **Page/URL**: Identify the route and its elements
- **Feature name**: Map to relevant app areas

### 2. Explore the Codebase

Use the `Explore` subagent to gather context:

- Read `playwright.config.ts` for `testDir`, `baseURL`, `projects`
- Check existing tests in `testDir` for patterns, fixtures, and conventions
- If a component path is given, read the component to understand its props, states, and interactions
- Check for existing page objects in `pages/`
- Check for existing fixtures in `fixtures/`
- Check for auth setup (`auth.setup.ts` or `storageState` config)

### 3. Select Templates

Check `templates/` in this plugin for matching patterns:

| If testing... | Load template from |
|---|---|
| Login/auth flow | `templates/auth/login.md` |
| CRUD operations | `templates/crud/` |
| Checkout/payment | `templates/checkout/` |
| Search/filter UI | `templates/search/` |
| Form submission | `templates/forms/` |
| Dashboard/data | `templates/dashboard/` |
| Settings page | `templates/settings/` |
| Onboarding flow | `templates/onboarding/` |
| API endpoints | `templates/api/` |
| Accessibility | `templates/accessibility/` |

Adapt the template to the specific app — replace `{{placeholders}}` with actual selectors, URLs, and data.

### 4. Generate the Test

Follow these rules:

**Structure:**
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
// Import custom fixtures if the project uses them

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  // Group related behaviors

  test('should <expected behavior>', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange: navigate, set up state
    // Act: perform user action
    // Assert: verify outcome
  });
});
```

**Locator priority** (use the first that works):
1. `getByRole()` — buttons, links, headings, form elements → verify: step output matches expected outcome
2. `getByLabel()` — form fields with labels → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. `getByText()` — non-interactive text content → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. `getByPlaceholder()` — inputs with placeholder text → verify: step output matches expected outcome
5. `getByTestId()` — when semantic options aren't available → verify: all tests pass

**Assertions** — always web-first:
```typescript
// GOOD — auto-retries
await expect(page.getByRole('heading')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.getByRole('alert')).toHaveText('Success');

// BAD — no retry
const text = await page.textContent('.msg');
expect(text).toBe('Success');
```

**Never use:**
- `page.waitForTimeout()`
- `page.$(selector)` or `page.$$(selector)`
- Bare CSS selectors unless absolutely necessary
- `page.evaluate()` for things locators can do

**Always include:**
- Descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Error/edge case tests alongside happy path
- Proper `await` on every Playwright call
- `baseURL`-relative navigation (`page.goto('/')` not `page.goto('http://...')`)

### 5. Match Project Conventions

- If project uses TypeScript → generate `.spec.ts`
- If project uses JavaScript → generate `.spec.js` with `require()` imports
- If project has page objects → use them instead of inline locators
- If project has custom fixtures → import and use them
- If project has a test data directory → create test data files there

### 6. Generate Supporting Files (If Needed)

- **Page object**: If the test touches 5+ unique locators on one page, create a page object
- **Fixture**: If the test needs shared setup (auth, data), create or extend a fixture
- **Test data**: If the test uses structured data, create a JSON file in `test-data/`

### 7. Verify

Run the generated test:

```bash
npx playwright test <generated-file> --reporter=list
```

If it fails:
1. Read the error → verify: file readable + content matches expected shape
2. Fix the test (not the app) → verify: all tests pass
3. Run again → verify: command exit code 0
4. If it's an app issue, report it to the user → verify: step output matches expected outcome

## Output

- Generated test file(s) with path
- Any supporting files created (page objects, fixtures, data)
- Test run result
- Coverage note: what behaviors are now tested

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to generate — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Generate needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for generate
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving generate
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
