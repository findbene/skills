# Stitch to React Components

You are a frontend engineer focused on transforming designs into clean React code. You follow a modular approach and use automated tools to ensure code quality.

## Retrieval and networking
1. **Namespace discovery**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix. Use this prefix (e.g., `stitch:`) for all subsequent calls. → verify: command exit code 0
2. **Metadata fetch**: Call `[prefix]:get_screen` to retrieve the design JSON. → verify: diff matches intended change
3. **Check for existing designs**: Before downloading, check if `.stitch/designs/{page}.html` and `.stitch/designs/{page}.png` already exist: → verify: file content matches expected shape
   - **If files exist**: Ask the user whether to refresh the designs from the Stitch project using the MCP, or reuse the existing local files. Only re-download if the user confirms.
   - **If files do not exist**: Proceed to step 4.
4. **High-reliability download**: Internal AI fetch tools can fail on Google Cloud Storage domains. → verify: file content matches expected shape
   - **HTML**: `bash scripts/fetch-stitch.sh "[htmlCode.downloadUrl]" ".stitch/designs/{page}.html"`
    - **Screenshot**: Append `=w{width}` to the screenshot URL first, where `{width}` is the `width` value from the screen metadata (Google CDN serves low-res thumbnails by default). Then run: `bash scripts/fetch-stitch.sh "[screenshot.downloadUrl]=w{width}" ".stitch/designs/{page}.png"`
   - This script handles the necessary redirects and security handshakes.
5. **Visual audit**: Review the downloaded screenshot (`.stitch/designs/{page}.png`) to confirm design intent and layout details. → verify: file content matches expected shape

## Architectural rules
* **Modular components**: Break the design into independent files. Avoid large, single-file outputs.
* **Logic isolation**: Move event handlers and business logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`.
* **Data decoupling**: Move all static text, image URLs, and lists into `src/data/mockData.ts`.
* **Type safety**: Every component must include a `Readonly` TypeScript interface named `[ComponentName]Props`.
* **Project specific**: Focus on the target project's needs and constraints. Leave Google license headers out of the generated React components.
* **Style mapping**:
    * Extract the `tailwind.config` from the HTML `<head>`.
    * Sync these values with `resources/style-guide.json`.
    * Use theme-mapped Tailwind classes instead of arbitrary hex codes.

## Execution steps
1. **Environment setup**: If `node_modules` is missing, run `npm install` to enable the validation tools. → verify: command exit code 0
2. **Data layer**: Create `src/data/mockData.ts` based on the design content. → verify: output file exists + no syntax error
3. **Component drafting**: Use `resources/component-template.tsx` as a base. Find and replace all instances of `StitchComponent` with the actual name of the component you are creating. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. **Application wiring**: Update the project entry point (like `App.tsx`) to render the new components. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
5. **Quality check**: → verify: all tests pass
    * Run `npm run validate <file_path>` for each component.
    * Verify the final output against the `resources/architecture-checklist.md`.
    * Start the dev server with `npm run dev` to verify the live result.

## Troubleshooting
* **Fetch errors**: Ensure the URL is quoted in the bash command to prevent shell errors.
* **Validation errors**: Review the AST report and fix any missing interfaces or hardcoded styles.

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to react components — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | React Components needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for react components
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving react components
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
