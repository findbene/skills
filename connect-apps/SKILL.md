# Connect Apps

Connect Claude to 1000+ apps. Actually send emails, create issues, post messages - not just generate text about it.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

```
/plugin install composio-toolrouter
```

### Step 2: Run Setup

```
/composio-toolrouter:setup
```

This will:
- Ask for your free API key (get one at [platform.composio.dev](https://platform.composio.dev/?utm_source=Github&utm_content=AwesomeSkills))
- Configure Claude's connection to 1000+ apps
- Take about 60 seconds

### Step 3: Try It!

After setup, restart Claude Code and try:

```
Send me a test email at YOUR_EMAIL@example.com
```

If it works, you're connected!

## What You Can Do

| Ask Claude to... | What happens |
|------------------|--------------|
| "Send email to sarah@acme.com about the launch" | Actually sends the email |
| "Create GitHub issue: fix login bug" | Creates the issue |
| "Post to Slack #general: deploy complete" | Posts the message |
| "Add meeting notes to Notion" | Adds to Notion |

## Supported Apps

**Email:** Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid
**Chat:** Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram
**Dev:** GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear
**Docs:** Notion, Google Docs, Confluence
**Data:** Sheets, Airtable, PostgreSQL
**And 1000+ more...**

## How It Works

1. You ask Claude to do something → verify: step output matches expected outcome
2. Composio Tool Router finds the right tool → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. First time? You'll authorize via OAuth (one-time) → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Action executes and returns result → verify: command exit code 0

## Troubleshooting

- **"Plugin not found"** → Make sure you ran `/plugin install composio-toolrouter`
- **"Need to authorize"** → Click the OAuth link Claude provides, then say "done"
- **Action failed** → Check you have permissions in the target app

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to connect apps — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Connect Apps needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for connect apps
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving connect apps
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
