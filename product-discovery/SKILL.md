# Product Discovery

Run structured discovery to identify high-value opportunities and de-risk product bets.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:
- Opportunity Solution Tree facilitation
- Assumption mapping and test planning
- Problem validation interviews and evidence synthesis
- Solution validation with prototypes/experiments
- Discovery sprint planning and outputs

## Core Discovery Workflow

1. Define desired outcome → verify: step output matches expected outcome
- Set one measurable outcome to improve.
- Establish baseline and target horizon.

2. Build Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) → verify: step output matches expected outcome
- Outcome -> opportunities -> solution ideas -> experiments
- Keep opportunities grounded in user evidence, not internal opinions.

3. Map assumptions → verify: step output matches expected outcome
- Identify desirability, viability, feasibility, and usability assumptions.
- Score assumptions by risk and certainty.

Use:
```bash
python3 scripts/assumption_mapper.py assumptions.csv
```

4. Validate the problem → verify: step output matches expected outcome
- Conduct interviews and behavior analysis.
- Confirm frequency, severity, and willingness to solve.
- Reject weak opportunities early.

5. Validate the solution → verify: step output matches expected outcome
- Prototype before building.
- Run concept, usability, and value tests.
- Measure behavior, not only stated preference.

6. Plan discovery sprint → verify: step output matches expected outcome
- 1-2 week cycle with explicit hypotheses
- Daily evidence reviews
- End with decision: proceed, pivot, or stop

## Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres)

Structure:
- Outcome: metric you want to move
- Opportunities: unmet customer needs/pains
- Solutions: candidate interventions
- Experiments: fastest learning actions

Quality checks:
- At least 3 distinct opportunities before converging.
- At least 2 experiments per top opportunity.
- Tie every branch to evidence source.

## Assumption Mapping

Assumption categories:
- Desirability: users want this
- Viability: business value exists
- Feasibility: team can build/operate it
- Usability: users can successfully use it

Prioritization rule:
- High risk + low certainty assumptions are tested first.

## Problem Validation Techniques

- Problem interviews focused on current behavior
- Journey friction mapping
- Support ticket and sales-call synthesis
- Behavioral analytics triangulation

Evidence threshold examples:
- Same pain repeated across multiple target users
- Observable workaround behavior
- Measurable cost of current pain

## Solution Validation Techniques

- Concept tests (value proposition comprehension)
- Prototype usability tests (task success/time-to-complete)
- Fake door or concierge tests (demand signal)
- Limited beta cohorts (retention/activation signals)

## Discovery Sprint Planning

Suggested 10-day structure:
- Day 1-2: Outcome + opportunity framing
- Day 3-4: Assumption mapping + test design
- Day 5-7: Problem and solution tests
- Day 8-9: Evidence synthesis + decision options
- Day 10: Stakeholder decision review

## Tooling

### `scripts/assumption_mapper.py`

CLI utility that:
- reads assumptions from CSV or inline input
- scores risk/certainty priority
- emits prioritized test plan with suggested test types

See `references/discovery-frameworks.md` for framework details.

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to product discovery — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Product Discovery needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for product discovery
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving product discovery
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
