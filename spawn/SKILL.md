# /hub:spawn — Launch Parallel Agents

Spawn N subagents that work on the same task in parallel, each in an isolated git worktree.

## Usage

```
/hub:spawn                                    # Spawn agents for the latest session
/hub:spawn 20260317-143022                    # Spawn agents for a specific session
/hub:spawn --template optimizer               # Use optimizer template for dispatch prompts
/hub:spawn --template refactorer              # Use refactorer template
```

## Templates

When `--template <name>` is provided, use the dispatch prompt from `references/agent-templates.md` instead of the default prompt below. Available templates:

| Template | Pattern | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `optimizer` | Edit → eval → keep/discard → repeat x10 | Performance, latency, size reduction |
| `refactorer` | Restructure → test → iterate until green | Code quality, tech debt |
| `test-writer` | Write tests → measure coverage → repeat | Test coverage gaps |
| `bug-fixer` | Reproduce → diagnose → fix → verify | Bug fix with competing approaches |

When using a template, replace all `{variables}` with values from the session config. Assign each agent a **different strategy** appropriate to the template and task — diverse strategies maximize the value of parallel exploration.

## What It Does

1. Load session config from `.agenthub/sessions/{session-id}/config.yaml` → verify: file content matches expected shape
2. For each agent 1..N: → verify: step output matches expected outcome
   - Write task assignment to `.agenthub/board/dispatch/`
   - Build agent prompt with task, constraints, and board write instructions
3. Launch ALL agents in a **single message** with multiple Agent tool calls: → verify: step output matches expected outcome

```
Agent(
  prompt: "You are agent-{i} in hub session {session-id}.

Your task: {task}

Read your full assignment at .agenthub/board/dispatch/{seq}-agent-{i}.md

Instructions:
1. Work in your worktree — make changes, run tests, iterate → verify: command exit code 0
2. Commit all changes with descriptive messages → verify: git status clean
3. Write your result summary to .agenthub/board/results/agent-{i}-result.md → verify: output exists + parses without error
   Include: approach taken, files changed, metric if available, confidence level
4. Exit when done → verify: step output matches expected outcome

Constraints:
- Do NOT read or modify other agents' work
- Do NOT access .agenthub/board/results/ for other agents
- Commit early and often with descriptive messages
- If you hit a dead end, commit what you have and explain in your result",
  isolation: "worktree"
)
```

4. Update session state to `running` via: → verify: command exit code 0
```bash
python {skill_path}/scripts/session_manager.py --update {session-id} --state running
```

## Critical Rules

- **All agents in ONE message** — spawn all Agent tool calls simultaneously for true parallelism
- **isolation: "worktree"** is mandatory — each agent needs its own filesystem
- **Never modify session config** after spawn — agents rely on stable configuration
- **Each agent gets a unique board post** — dispatch posts are numbered sequentially

## After Spawn

Tell the user:
- {N} agents launched in parallel
- Each working in an isolated worktree
- Monitor with `/hub:status`
- Evaluate when done with `/hub:eval`

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to spawn — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Spawn needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for spawn
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving spawn
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
