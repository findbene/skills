# HyperFrames Registry

The registry provides reusable blocks and components installable via `hyperframes add <name>`.

- **Blocks** — standalone sub-compositions (own dimensions, duration, timeline). Included via `data-composition-src` in a host composition.
- **Components** — effect snippets (no own dimensions). Pasted directly into a host composition's HTML.

## When to use this skill

- User mentions `hyperframes add`, "block", "component", or `hyperframes.json`
- Output from `hyperframes add` appears in the session (file paths, clipboard snippet)
- You need to wire an installed item into an existing composition
- You want to discover what's available in the registry

## Quick reference

```bash
hyperframes add data-chart              # install a block
hyperframes add grain-overlay           # install a component
hyperframes add shimmer-sweep --dir .   # target a specific project
hyperframes add data-chart --json       # machine-readable output
hyperframes add data-chart --no-clipboard  # skip clipboard (CI/headless)
```

After install, the CLI prints which files were written and a snippet to paste into your host composition. The snippet is a starting point — you'll need to add `data-composition-id` (must match the block's internal composition ID), `data-start`, and `data-track-index` attributes when wiring blocks.

Note: `hyperframes add` only works for blocks and components. For examples, use `hyperframes init <dir> --example <name>` instead.

## Install locations

Blocks install to `compositions/<name>.html` by default.
Components install to `compositions/components/<name>.html` by default.

These paths are configurable in `hyperframes.json`:

```json
{
  "registry": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heygen-com/hyperframes/main/registry",
  "paths": {
    "blocks": "compositions",
    "components": "compositions/components",
    "assets": "assets"
  }
}
```

See [install-locations.md](./references/install-locations.md) for full details.

## Wiring blocks

Blocks are standalone compositions — include them via `data-composition-src` in your host `index.html`:

```html
<div
  data-composition-id="data-chart"
  data-composition-src="compositions/data-chart.html"
  data-start="2"
  data-duration="15"
  data-track-index="1"
  data-width="1920"
  data-height="1080"
></div>
```

Key attributes:

- `data-composition-src` — path to the block HTML file
- `data-composition-id` — must match the block's internal ID
- `data-start` — when the block appears in the host timeline (seconds)
- `data-duration` — how long the block plays
- `data-width` / `data-height` — block canvas dimensions
- `data-track-index` — layer ordering (higher = in front)

See [wiring-blocks.md](./references/wiring-blocks.md) for full details.

## Wiring components

Components are snippets — paste their HTML into your composition's markup, their CSS into your style block, and their JS into your script (if any):

1. Read the installed file (e.g., `compositions/components/grain-overlay.html`) → verify: file content matches expected shape
2. Copy the HTML elements into your composition's `<div data-composition-id="...">` → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. Copy the `<style>` block into your composition's styles → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Copy any `<script>` content into your composition's script (before your timeline code) → verify: step output matches expected outcome
5. If the component exposes GSAP timeline integration (see the comment block in the snippet), add those calls to your timeline → verify: dependency resolves + import works

See [wiring-components.md](./references/wiring-components.md) for full details.

## Discovery

Browse available items:

```bash
# Read the registry manifest
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heygen-com/hyperframes/main/registry/registry.json
```

Each item's `registry-item.json` contains: name, type, title, description, tags, dimensions (blocks only), duration (blocks only), and file list.

See [discovery.md](./references/discovery.md) for details on filtering by type and tags.

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to hyperframes registry — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Hyperframes Registry needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for hyperframes registry
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving hyperframes registry
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
