# Lottie for HyperFrames

HyperFrames can seek both `lottie-web` and dotLottie players through its `lottie` runtime adapter. Lottie is a strong fit because the animation timeline is already encoded in the asset; HyperFrames only needs a player object it can seek.

## Contract

- Load assets from local project files, usually under `assets/`.
- Set `autoplay: false`.
- Prefer `loop: false` unless the user explicitly wants a loop.
- Register every returned animation or player on `window.__hfLottie`.
- Keep the Lottie container dimensions stable with CSS.

The adapter seeks `lottie-web` with `goToAndStop(timeMs, false)` and dotLottie with frame or percentage APIs depending on player shape.

## lottie-web Pattern

```html
<div id="logo-lottie" class="lottie-layer"></div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bodymovin/5.12.2/lottie.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const anim = lottie.loadAnimation({
    container: document.getElementById("logo-lottie"),
    renderer: "svg",
    loop: false,
    autoplay: false,
    path: "assets/logo-reveal.json",
  });

  window.__hfLottie = window.__hfLottie || [];
  window.__hfLottie.push(anim);
</script>
```

```css
.lottie-layer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

## dotLottie Pattern

```html
<canvas id="product-lottie" class="lottie-canvas"></canvas>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@lottiefiles/dotlottie-web"></script>
<script>
  const player = new DotLottie({
    canvas: document.getElementById("product-lottie"),
    src: "assets/product-flow.lottie",
    autoplay: false,
    loop: false,
  });

  window.__hfLottie = window.__hfLottie || [];
  window.__hfLottie.push(player);
</script>
```

```css
.lottie-canvas {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: block;
}
```

## Multiple Animations

Push each player into the same registry:

```js
window.__hfLottie = window.__hfLottie || [];
window.__hfLottie.push(backgroundAnim);
window.__hfLottie.push(iconAnim);
window.__hfLottie.push(confettiAnim);
```

HyperFrames seeks them all to the same composition time.

## Good Uses

- After Effects exports that are already known to render correctly in lottie-web.
- Logo reveals, icon loops, decorative accents, and product UI motion.
- Translating Remotion Lottie usage into plain HyperFrames HTML.

## Avoid

- Relying on remote `path` URLs at render time.
- Starting playback with `play()`.
- Assuming unsupported After Effects effects will survive export. Test the JSON or `.lottie` file in a browser first.
- Loading a player asynchronously and registering it after HyperFrames validation has already inspected the page.

## Validation

After editing a Lottie composition:

```bash
npx hyperframes lint
npx hyperframes validate
```

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to lottie — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Lottie needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for lottie
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving lottie
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
