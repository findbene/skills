# ElevenLabs Design System

Reusable design system skill scaffolded from `DESIGN.md`. Source: VoltAgent/awesome-claude-design + getdesign.md.

## When to use

User asks to build, scaffold, or style UI matching ElevenLabs's visual language. Also: "make it look like ElevenLabs", "use ElevenLabs aesthetic", "ElevenLabs-style components".

## How to apply

1. Read `DESIGN.md` (bundled in this skill dir) — contains full token spec. → verify: file exists and `colors:` / `typography:` blocks present
2. Emit CSS variables from `colors:` section verbatim. → verify: hex values match DESIGN.md spec
3. Build type scale from `typography:` block. → verify: font-family + weight scale defined
4. Apply component patterns from `components:` section. → verify: each component uses spec radii/shadows
5. Respect `dos_donts:` rules — these are guardrails. → verify: no `dos_donts:` rule violated
6. Use `agent_prompt_guide:` reusable prompts for new screens. → verify: prompts referenced when generating UI

## Files

- `DESIGN.md` — full design system spec (ElevenLabs)

## When NOT to use

- User wants brand-agnostic design → use generic `frontend-design` skill instead
- Different brand requested → use the matching `design-<brand>` skill
- User needs plain Tailwind/CSS without brand language → skip design-* skills
- Building production replica of Elevenlabs itself (trademark / IP risk)

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll pick close hex values instead of exact" | Brand voltage must match exact — close hex breaks brand recognition |
| "Tailwind defaults are close enough" | Brand radii/shadows/spacing are non-default; defaults break the look |
| "Skip DESIGN.md, just match vibes" | Tokens encode the rules; vibes drift |
| "Apply brand color everywhere" | Brand uses CTA/accent voltage sparingly — uniform application kills hierarchy |

## Output Contract

Done-state:
- All color values traceable to `DESIGN.md` `colors:` block
- Typography scale uses brand font + brand weight ladder from `typography:`
- Component radii, shadows, spacing match `components:` tokens
- No `dos_donts:` rule violated in generated output
- CSS variables exposed for downstream re-theming

## Examples

### Example 1 — Marketing hero
- Input: "Build a marketing hero in Elevenlabs style"
- Action: read `DESIGN.md`, apply brand background/typography/CTA radius + brand voltage color, follow whitespace guidance from spec
- Output: hero section using exact brand tokens, ready to drop into Next.js or HTML

### Example 2 — Card grid
- Input: "Card grid that looks like Elevenlabs"
- Action: pull card radius from `components:`, shadow from `shadows:`, gap from `spacing:`, hover state from `dos_donts:` guidance
- Output: grid with brand-correct card chrome, no default Tailwind leakage

## Brand summary

A voice-AI brand whose marketing surfaces read like a quietly editorial print magazine. The base canvas is off-white (`#f5f5f5`) holding warm near-black ink (`#292524`); the brand voltage is photographic, not chromatic — soft pastel atmospheric gradient orbs (mint → peach → lavender → sky) drift through the page as the only "color" moments. Display runs Waldenburg Light at weight 300 — the editorial signature. Inter carries body, navigation, captions. CTAs are subtle: a near-black ink pill is the primary, a transparent outline is the secondary. The brand trusts atmospheric photography and modest type weights to do all of the brand work; there is no neon accent, no saturated CTA color, no developer-tools dark canvas.
