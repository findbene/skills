## Overview

Analyze a codebase and generate onboarding documentation for engineers, tech leads, and contractors. This skill is optimized for fast fact-gathering and repeatable onboarding outputs.

## Core Capabilities

- Architecture and stack discovery from repository signals
- Key file and config inventory for new contributors
- Local setup and common-task guidance generation
- Audience-aware documentation framing
- Debugging and contribution checklist scaffolding

---

## When to Use

- Onboarding a new team member or contractor
- Rebuilding stale project docs after large refactors
- Preparing internal handoff documentation
- Creating a standardized onboarding packet for services

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Gather codebase facts
python3 scripts/codebase_analyzer.py /path/to/repo

# 2) Export machine-readable output
python3 scripts/codebase_analyzer.py /path/to/repo --json

# 3) Use the template to draft onboarding docs
# See references/onboarding-template.md
```

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Run `scripts/codebase_analyzer.py` against the target repository. → verify: command exit code 0
2. Capture key signals: file counts, detected languages, config files, top-level structure. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. Fill the onboarding template in `references/onboarding-template.md`. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Tailor output depth by audience: → verify: step output matches expected outcome
   - Junior: setup + guardrails
   - Senior: architecture + operational concerns
   - Contractor: scoped ownership + integration boundaries

---

## Onboarding Document Template

Detailed template and section examples live in:
- `references/onboarding-template.md`
- `references/output-format-templates.md`

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Writing docs without validating setup commands on a clean environment
- Mixing architecture deep-dives into contractor-oriented docs
- Omitting troubleshooting and verification steps
- Letting onboarding docs drift from current repo state

## Best Practices

1. Keep setup instructions executable and time-bounded. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
2. Document the "why" for key architectural decisions. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. Update docs in the same PR as behavior changes. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Treat onboarding docs as living operational assets, not one-time deliverables. → verify: step output matches expected outcome

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to codebase onboarding — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Codebase Onboarding needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for codebase onboarding
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving codebase onboarding
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
