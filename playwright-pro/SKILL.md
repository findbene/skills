# Playwright Pro

Production-grade Playwright testing toolkit for AI coding agents.

## Available Commands

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, these are available as `/pw:` commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pw:init` | Set up Playwright — detects framework, generates config, CI, first test |
| `/pw:generate <spec>` | Generate tests from user story, URL, or component |
| `/pw:review` | Review tests for anti-patterns and coverage gaps |
| `/pw:fix <test>` | Diagnose and fix failing or flaky tests |
| `/pw:migrate` | Migrate from Cypress or Selenium to Playwright |
| `/pw:coverage` | Analyze what's tested vs. what's missing |
| `/pw:testrail` | Sync with TestRail — read cases, push results |
| `/pw:browserstack` | Run on BrowserStack, pull cross-browser reports |
| `/pw:report` | Generate test report in your preferred format |

## Quick Start Workflow

The recommended sequence for most projects:

```
1. /pw:init          → scaffolds config, CI pipeline, and a first smoke test
2. /pw:generate      → generates tests from your spec or URL
3. /pw:review        → validates quality and flags anti-patterns      ← always run after generate
4. /pw:fix <test>    → diagnoses and repairs any failing/flaky tests  ← run when CI turns red
```

**Validation checkpoints:**
- After `/pw:generate` — always run `/pw:review` before committing; it catches locator anti-patterns and missing assertions automatically.
- After `/pw:fix` — re-run the full suite locally (`npx playwright test`) to confirm the fix doesn't introduce regressions.
- After `/pw:migrate` — run `/pw:coverage` to confirm parity with the old suite before decommissioning Cypress/Selenium tests.

### Example: Generate → Review → Fix

```bash
# 1. Generate tests from a user story
/pw:generate "As a user I can log in with email and password"

# Generated: tests/auth/login.spec.ts
# → Playwright Pro creates the file using the auth template.

# 2. Review the generated tests
/pw:review tests/auth/login.spec.ts

# → Flags: one test used page.locator('input[type=password]') — suggests getByLabel('Password')
# → Fix applied automatically.

# 3. Run locally to confirm
npx playwright test tests/auth/login.spec.ts --headed

# 4. If a test is flaky in CI, diagnose it
/pw:fix tests/auth/login.spec.ts
# → Identifies missing web-first assertion; replaces waitForTimeout(2000) with expect(locator).toBeVisible()
```

## Golden Rules

1. `getByRole()` over CSS/XPath — resilient to markup changes → verify: step output matches expected outcome
2. Never `page.waitForTimeout()` — use web-first assertions → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. `expect(locator)` auto-retries; `expect(await locator.textContent())` does not → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Isolate every test — no shared state between tests → verify: all checks pass
5. `baseURL` in config — zero hardcoded URLs → verify: step output matches expected outcome
6. Retries: `2` in CI, `0` locally → verify: step output matches expected outcome
7. Traces: `'on-first-retry'` — rich debugging without slowdown → verify: step output matches expected outcome
8. Fixtures over globals — `test.extend()` for shared state → verify: all checks pass
9. One behavior per test — multiple related assertions are fine → verify: all checks pass
10. Mock external services only — never mock your own app → verify: step output matches expected outcome

## Locator Priority

```
1. getByRole()        — buttons, links, headings, form elements → verify: step output matches expected outcome
2. getByLabel()       — form fields with labels → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. getByText()        — non-interactive text → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. getByPlaceholder() — inputs with placeholder → verify: step output matches expected outcome
5. getByTestId()      — when no semantic option exists → verify: all checks pass
6. page.locator()     — CSS/XPath as last resort → verify: step output matches expected outcome
```

## What's Included

- **9 skills** with detailed step-by-step instructions
- **3 specialized agents**: test-architect, test-debugger, migration-planner
- **55 test templates**: auth, CRUD, checkout, search, forms, dashboard, settings, onboarding, notifications, API, accessibility
- **2 MCP servers** (TypeScript): TestRail and BrowserStack integrations
- **Smart hooks**: auto-validate test quality, auto-detect Playwright projects
- **6 reference docs**: golden rules, locators, assertions, fixtures, pitfalls, flaky tests
- **Migration guides**: Cypress and Selenium mapping tables

export TESTRAIL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### BrowserStack (Optional)
```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="your-username"
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
```

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to playwright pro — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Playwright Pro needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for playwright pro
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving playwright pro
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
