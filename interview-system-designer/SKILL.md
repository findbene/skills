# Interview System Designer

Comprehensive interview loop planning and calibration support for role-based hiring systems.

## Overview

Use this skill to create structured interview loops, standardize question quality, and keep hiring signal consistent across interviewers.

## Core Capabilities

- Interview loop planning by role and level
- Round-by-round focus and timing recommendations
- Suggested question sets by round type
- Framework support for scoring and calibration
- Bias-reduction and process consistency guidance

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate a loop plan for a role and level
python3 scripts/interview_planner.py --role "Senior Software Engineer" --level senior

# JSON output for integration with internal tooling
python3 scripts/interview_planner.py --role "Product Manager" --level mid --json
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Run `scripts/interview_planner.py` to generate a baseline loop. → verify: output file exists + no syntax error
2. Align rounds to role-specific competencies. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. Validate scoring rubric consistency with interview panel leads. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Review for bias controls before rollout. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
5. Recalibrate quarterly using hiring outcome data. → verify: step output matches expected outcome

## Common Pitfalls

- Overweighting one round while ignoring other competency signals
- Using unstructured interviews without standardized scoring
- Skipping calibration sessions for interviewers
- Changing hiring bar without documenting rationale

## Best Practices

1. Keep round objectives explicit and non-overlapping. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
2. Require evidence for each score recommendation. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. Use the same baseline rubric across comparable roles. → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. Revisit loop design based on quality-of-hire outcomes. → verify: step output matches expected outcome

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to interview system designer — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Interview System Designer needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for interview system designer
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving interview system designer
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
