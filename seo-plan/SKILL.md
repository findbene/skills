## DataForSEO Integration (Optional)

If DataForSEO MCP tools are available, use `dataforseo_labs_google_competitors_domain` and `dataforseo_labs_google_domain_intersection` for real competitive intelligence, `dataforseo_labs_bulk_traffic_estimation` for traffic estimates, `kw_data_google_ads_search_volume` and `dataforseo_labs_bulk_keyword_difficulty` for keyword research, and `business_data_business_listings_search` for local business data.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Unrecognized business type | Fall back to `generic.md` template. Inform user that no industry-specific template was found and proceed with the general business template. |
| No website URL provided | Proceed with new-site planning mode. Skip current site assessment and competitive gap analysis that require a live URL. |
| Industry template not found | Check `assets/` directory for available templates. If the requested template file is missing, use `generic.md` and note the missing template in output. |
