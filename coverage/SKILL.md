# Analyze Test Coverage Gaps

Map all testable surfaces in the application and identify what's tested vs. what's missing.

## Steps

### 1. Map Application Surface

Use the `Explore` subagent to catalog:

**Routes/Pages:**
- Scan route definitions (Next.js `app/`, React Router config, Vue Router, etc.)
- List all user-facing pages with their paths

**Components:**
- Identify interactive components (forms, modals, dropdowns, tables)
- Note components with complex state logic

**API Endpoints:**
- Scan API route files or backend controllers
- List all endpoints with their methods

**User Flows:**
- Identify critical paths: auth, checkout, onboarding, core features
- Map multi-step workflows

### 2. Map Existing Tests

Scan all `*.spec.ts` / `*.spec.js` files:

- Extract which pages/routes are covered (by `page.goto()` calls)
- Extract which components are tested (by locator usage)
- Extract which API endpoints are mocked or hit
- Count tests per area

### 3. Generate Coverage Matrix

```
## Coverage Matrix

| Area | Route | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth | /login | 5 | ✅ Covered |
| Auth | /register | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| Auth | /forgot-password | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| Dashboard | /dashboard | 3 | ⚠️ Partial (no error states) |
| Settings | /settings | 0 | ❌ Missing |
| Checkout | /checkout | 8 | ✅ Covered |
```

### 4. Prioritize Gaps

Rank uncovered areas by business impact:

1. **Critical** — auth, payment, core features → test first
2. **High** — user-facing CRUD, search, navigation → verify: step output matches expected outcome
3. **Medium** — settings, preferences, edge cases → verify: step output matches expected outcome
4. **Low** — static pages, about, terms → verify: step output matches expected outcome

### 5. Suggest Test Plan

For each gap, recommend:
- Number of tests needed
- Which template from `templates/` to use
- Estimated effort (quick/medium/complex)

```
## Recommended Test Plan

### Priority 1: Critical
1. /register (4 tests) — use auth/registration template — quick → verify: all checks pass
2. /forgot-password (3 tests) — use auth/password-reset template — quick → verify: all checks pass

### Priority 2: High
3. /settings (4 tests) — use settings/ templates — medium → verify: all checks pass
4. Dashboard error states (2 tests) — use dashboard/data-loading template — quick → verify: file content matches expected shape
```

### 6. Auto-Generate (Optional)

Ask user: "Generate tests for the top N gaps? [Yes/No/Pick specific]"

If yes, invoke `/pw:generate` for each gap with the recommended template.

## Output

- Coverage matrix (table format)
- Coverage percentage estimate
- Prioritized gap list with effort estimates
- Option to auto-generate missing tests

## When NOT to use

- Task is unrelated to coverage — pick a domain-specific skill instead
- Simple one-line operation that doesn't need this skill's structure
- User explicitly asks for raw output without skill discipline → respect override
- Different toolchain / framework required → search with `find-skills` for alternatives

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Output looks right, skip verify" | Eyeball checks miss edge cases — run the verify step |
| "Generic template is good enough" | Coverage needs domain-specific judgment, not boilerplate |
| "I'll inline the context, no need to read references" | Context drift produces stale output; check linked references |
| "One more shortcut won't hurt" | Shortcuts compound — finish the discipline before declaring done |

## Output Contract

Done when:
- Primary deliverable produced matches user's stated goal for coverage
- Every verify step in the process passed
- Edge cases addressed or explicitly flagged with assumption
- Output reproducible — no hidden state or one-time setup
- Brief hand-off summary so user can validate without rereading the full flow

## Examples

### Example 1 — golden path
- Input: standard user request involving coverage
- Action: follow the documented numbered process with verify clauses at each step
- Output: deliverable matching the Output Contract above

### Example 2 — edge case
- Input: request with partial info, non-standard constraint, or conflicting requirements
- Action: detect the gap, surface a clarifying question OR document the assumption explicitly, then proceed with adapted process
- Output: deliverable + explicit note on the assumption/limitation taken
